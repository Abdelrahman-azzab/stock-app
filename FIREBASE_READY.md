# ðŸ”¥ Firebase Deployment Ready!

## âœ… Changes Made for Firebase Hosting

Your stock management app has been successfully configured for Firebase Hosting deployment instead of Vercel. Here's what was changed:

### Configuration Updates

1. **Next.js Configuration** (`next.config.js`):
   - Added `output: 'export'` for static site generation
   - Added `trailingSlash: true` for Firebase compatibility
   - Added `images: { unoptimized: true }` for static export
   - Removed server-side i18n configuration

2. **Internationalization System**:
   - Replaced `next-i18next` with custom client-side i18n solution (`lib/i18n.ts`)
   - Maintains full bilingual support (English/Arabic) with RTL
   - Language preference stored in localStorage
   - All components updated to use new translation system

3. **Package Configuration** (`package.json`):
   - Added `firebase-tools` as dev dependency
   - Added deployment scripts:
     - `npm run deploy` - builds and deploys in one command
     - `npm run firebase:init` - initializes Firebase hosting
     - `npm run firebase:deploy` - deploys to Firebase

4. **Build Output**:
   - Static files exported to `out/` directory
   - Optimized for Firebase Hosting
   - All functionality preserved (themes, translations, Firebase database)
