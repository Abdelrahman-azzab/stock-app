# Deployment Guide

This guide covers two deployment options for your Stock Management System:

## Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel provides the best experience for Next.js applications with automatic deployments and excellent performance.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. Push your code to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
2. Ensure your `.env.local` file is NOT committed (it's in `.gitignore`)

### Step 2: Connect to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New Project"
3. Connect your Git repository
4. Select your stock management repository

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In the Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Click "Deploy" - Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app
2. Your app will be available at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### Step 5: Set Up Automatic Deployments

- Every push to your main branch will automatically trigger a new deployment
- Pull requests will create preview deployments

## Option 2: Deploy to Firebase Hosting

### Step 1: Install Firebase CLI

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Step 2: Login to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
```

### Step 3: Initialize Firebase Hosting

```bash
firebase init hosting
```

Select:
- Use an existing project (your Firebase project)
- Public directory: `out`
- Configure as single-page app: Yes
- Set up automatic builds: No (for now)

### Step 4: Build for Static Export

Add this to your `next.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: {
    unoptimized: true
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Build and Deploy

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

## Firebase Setup

Regardless of hosting choice, you need a Firebase project:

### 1. Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Enter project name (e.g., "stock-management-app")
4. Disable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create project"

### 2. Enable Firestore

1. In your Firebase project, go to "Firestore Database"
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
4. Select a location close to your users
5. Click "Done"

### 3. Get Configuration

1. Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
2. Scroll down to "Your apps"
3. Click "Web app" (</> icon)
4. Register your app with a name
5. Copy the config object values to your environment variables

### 4. Set Up Security Rules (Production)

For production, replace the default Firestore rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /inventory/stock {
      allow read, write: if true; // Adjust based on your auth requirements
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Domain Setup (Optional)

### For Vercel:
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

### For Firebase:
1. In Firebase Console, go to Hosting
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the verification and DNS setup instructions

---

## Environment Variables Security

### Production Best Practices:

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** - it's in `.gitignore`
2. **Use platform environment variables** - set them in your hosting dashboard
3. **Restrict Firebase access** - configure proper Firestore security rules
4. **Monitor usage** - check Firebase usage in the console

### Required Environment Variables:

All environment variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser, which is necessary for Firebase client-side operations.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors:
- Check that all environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Firebase configuration is valid
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Firebase Connection Issues:
- Verify your Firebase project ID is correct
- Check that Firestore is enabled
- Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions

### Deployment Failures:
- Check build logs for specific error messages
- Verify all required files are committed to your repository
- Ensure your hosting platform has all environment variables set
